# Deep Reinforcement Learning - Exercise Solutions

Welcome to the repository for solutions to the questions and exercises from the book *Deep Reinforcement Learning*, written by Aske Plaat. This repository is intended to assist learners using the book for self-study by providing solutions to the exercises included in the text.

Please note that the solutions and code provided in this repository are my own interpretations and implementations of the exercises from *Deep Reinforcement Learning*. They are not authored or endorsed by Aske Plaat or Springer Nature.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to support others who are studying reinforcement learning using this book. I encourage all users to attempt the exercises on their own before consulting these solutions to gain the most from the learning experience.
